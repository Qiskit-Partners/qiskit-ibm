    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackendService.jobs` and 
    :meth:`~qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackendService.retrieve_job` now only retrieve jobs 
    that are run with the ``circuit-runner`` or ``qasm3-runner`` programs.
    Jobs run from ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` will not be retrievable because their results
    are in an unsupported format.
