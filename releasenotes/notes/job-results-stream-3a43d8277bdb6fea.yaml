    For runtime jobs, there is no longer continuous polling of the api
    to check the status of a job. Instead, the stream endpoint of the 
    websocket server is used. If the stream is open, that indicates the job has not
    yet completed and once the job has completed, the websocket 
    server will terminate the connection.
