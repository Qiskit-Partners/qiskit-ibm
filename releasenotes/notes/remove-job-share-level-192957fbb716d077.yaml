    Job share level is no longer supported due to low adoption and the
    corresponding interface has been removed.
    This means you can no longer pass `share_level` when creating a job. The
    `qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.share_level` method to get a job's share level
    has also been removed.
